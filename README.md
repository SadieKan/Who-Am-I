### 50-Word Description of Myself
My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade 10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or clarification when needed.

### 50-Word Description of My Career Plans
My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I enter the field of computers, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software developer.
