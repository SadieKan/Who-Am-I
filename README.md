### 50-Word Description of Myself
My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade 10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or clarification when needed.

### 50-Word Description of My Career Plans
My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software developer.

# Chinese: Celebrations and Customs
Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese celebrations. This day marks the start of the new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration constantly changes, usually in late January or early February. In Chinese, it is called _"Chunjie"_ which means "Spring Festival."
- Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year and good luck.
- Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.
- This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)
- Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you should not sweep or throw out garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to insure that you do not wash away the good luck.
- On Chinese New Years, red packets (_"Hongboa"_) containing money are passed outs. This is usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but that are also exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.
_During this period of time, my family along with our family friends usually hold a series of large parties. Each party is takes place at a different person's house. We don't always have firecrackers, but we still put up the decorations, eat the special food, and hand out red packets at every party. We sometimes go to China to celebrate if we have the time. Even if we can't visit our family, we still send virtual red packets which we "snatch" and we also wish eachother "xin nian kuai le" or “gong xi fa cai”_

Every year, Chinese New Year's celebrates a zodiac animal. There are 12 zodiac animals, one for each year. The next Chinese New Year's festival in 2021 will be celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs also represent traits given to the people born in their year.
  - It is believed that your _"benming year"_ (year of your zodiac animal) is the unluckiest year for you, but it is also your rebirth year.

The Lantern Festival, celebrated on the 15th day of the first lunar month, concludes the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year). This festival takes place on the night of the first full moon in the lunar calendar and is dedicated to honoring the deceased.
- The main part of this festival is the lighting and the releasing of lanterns. The lanterns are adorned with artworkd of traditional Chinese images and symbols. The Chinese word or lantern is similar to another word meaning "new-born baby boy". These lanterns represent "illuminating the future and giving birth." They are also a way for people to pray for their family and a prosperous future. Women also walk under hanging lanterns in hopes of becoming pregnant and having a baby
- Riddles are also written on the lanterns. People crowd around hoping to find an answer. If you do have an answer, you go to the lantern owner, and if you are correct, you get a small prize.
- Lion dances are performed at this festival in order to ward off evil and pray for fortune and safety
- It is a tradition to eat tanyuan on this day. They represent wholeness and unity. By eating them, you are expressing your best wishes for your family and their future.

In most places around the world, your age when you are born is 0. Meanwhile, in China, a newborn baby is considered to be one year old at birth. Birthday celebrations are mainly for children and the elderly. Similar to many other Chinese celebrations, there are special foods eaten on birthdays along with traditions.
  - A child's first birthday in China is important and is called _"Zhuazhou"_. There is usually a ceremony in which the child chooses from an assortment of items that will determine their future inclinations/capabilities. _I had chosen an abacus on my first birthday, which represents that I might enjoy working with money and may have a future as a financier/business person._
  - Longevity noodles with an egg on top is eaten on people's birthdays. The noodles are meant to be eaten without being bitten/broken apart. This is because the noodles are meant to represent a long life, and if you break them, it is seen as bad luck and an omen that your life may be short.
  - In China, the people also have two birthdays, one following the lunar calendar, the other is the Gregorian calendar.

The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar which is usually in September or early October. It is considered to be the second most important Chinese festival (after Chinese New Year) and is a day to celebrate together with your family. On this day, family members come together to eat mooncake, worship the moon, eat dinner together. and display lanterns. _Similar to other celebrations, either my family or one of the families we are friends with will host a party. Since moon cake is the staple of this festival, we are sure to eat lost of it. Sometimes, some of the moms will even make their own mooncakes._

# Hobbies and Pastimes
- I have played the viola since I was 6 and the piano since I was 7. I can also play the violin, though I am not as good at it as I am the other instruments. Though I do not like going to music lessons, I enjoy finding music I like online and playing it on my instruments.
- I enjoy art, more specifically, creating digital art, simple sketches, and sometimes acrylic painting. I am fond of drawing people, whether it be photos of random people from Pinterest or celebrities that I like. I also like to create drawings and paintings of anime characters that I like. I sometimes use these paintings as decorations for my room.
- I like enjoy reading, especially when I am stressed. When I am reading, I become so immersed in the book and the story that I almost forget my worries. I don't have a particular genre that I like the most, per say. But I do enjoy fantasy. One of my current favorite series is "The Folk of the Air" trilogy by Holly Black.
- Though I do not consider myself a "gamer", I do enjoy playing video games, mainly on my PC. I have recently taken a break from gaming, trying to restrict the amount of time is spend playing video games and trying not to have it get in the way of my school work.
- I am a fan of kpop. I first started listening to kpop a little less than two years ago. I enjoy not only the music, but also the choreography for their performances and the visuals for their music videos. My current favorite kpop groups include: BTS, Straykids, Seventeen, NCT, and Ateez.
- Along with kpop, I am also a fan of anime. I have watched anime growing up, starting with Naruto and Sailor moon. I don't have a favorite anime, but I am currently watching Jujutsu Kaisen and JJBA.

- When I am home I spend most of my free time either watching YouTube/Netflix or messaging my friends on discord.
- When I hanging out with my friends (not that much now, since there is Corona),  we mainly like to go shopping, watch a movie at someone's house (sleepover), or go to the Rec Room.
