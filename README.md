### 50-Word Description of Myself
My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade 10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or clarification when needed.

### 50-Word Description of My Career Plans
My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software developer.

## Celebrations and Customs
Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese celebrations. This day marks the start of the new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration constantly changes, usually in late January or early February. In Chinese, it is called _"Chunjie"_ which means "Spring Festival."
- Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year and good luck.
- Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.
- This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)
- Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you should not sweep or throw out garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to insure that you do not wash away the good luck.
- On Chinese New Years, red packets (_"Hongboa"_) containing money are passed outs. This is usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but that are also exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.
- Every year, this celebration celebrates a zodiac animal. There are 12 zodiacs and there is an animal for each year. The next Chinese New Year's festival will be celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs also represent traits given to the people born in their year.
  - It is believed that your _"benming year"_ (year of your zodiac animal) is the unluckiest year for you, but it is also your rebirth year.
