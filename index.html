        <article>
          <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
            My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and
            raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade
            10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or
            clarification when needed.

        <h3 style="font-family:'Playfair Display', serif;">50-Word Description of My Career Plans</h3>
        <article>
          <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
            My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to
            study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as
            I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as
            I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying
            computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software
            developer.
