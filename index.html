            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and
                raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade
                10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or
                clarification when needed.

            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to
                study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as
                I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as
                I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying
                computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software
                developer.

              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <b>Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese
                celebrations. This day marks the start of the new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration
                constantly changes, usually in late January or early February. In Chinese, it is called <i>"Chunjie"</i>
                which means "Spring Festival."</b>
              </p>
              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth
                  and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year
                  and good luck.</li>
                <li>Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new
                  clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.</li>
                <li>This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)</li>
                <li>Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you
                  should not sweep or throw out the garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to
                  ensure that you do not wash away the good luck.</li>
                <li>On Chinese New Year, red packets (<i>"Hongboa"</i>) containing money are passed outs. This is
                  usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but it's also
                  exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.</li>
                <li><i>During this celebration, my family along with our family friends usually hold a series of large
                  parties. Each party takes place in a different person's house. We don't always have firecrackers, but
                  we still put up the decorations, eat special food, and hand out red packets at every party. We
                  sometimes go to China to celebrate if we have the time. Even if we can't visit our family, we still
                  send virtual red packets which we "snatch" and we also wish each other "xin nian kuai le" or “gong xi
                  fa cai”</i></li>

                There are 12 zodiac animals, one for each year. The next Chinese New Year's festival in 2021 will be
                celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs also represent traits given to the people born in their

                <b>The Lantern Festival, celebrated on the 15th day of the
                first lunar month, concludes the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year). This festival takes place on the
                night of the first full moon in the lunar calendar and is dedicated to honoring the deceased.</b>

              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>The main part of this festival is the lighting and release of lanterns. The lanterns are adorned
                  with artwork of traditional Chinese images and symbols. The Chinese word or lantern is similar to
                  another word meaning "new-born baby boy". These lanterns represent "illuminating the future and
                  giving birth." They are also a way for people to pray for their family and a prosperous future.
                  Women also walk under hanging lanterns in hopes of becoming pregnant and having a baby.</li>
                <li>Riddles are also written on the lanterns. People crowd around hoping to find an answer. If you do
                  have an answer, you go to the lantern owner, and if you are correct, you get a small prize.</li>
                <li>Lion dances are performed at this festival to ward off evil and pray for fortune and safety</li>
                <li>It is a tradition to eat <i>"tangyuan"</i> on this day. They represent wholeness and unity. By eating them,
                  you are expressing your best wishes towards your family and their future.</li>

                are special foods eaten on birthdays along with traditions.</b>

              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>A child's first birthday in China is important and is called <i>"Zhuazhou"</i>. There is usually a
                  ceremony in which the child chooses from an assortment of items that will determine their future
                  inclinations/capabilities. <i>I had chosen an abacus on my first birthday, which represents that I
                    might enjoy working with money and may have a future as a financier/business person.</i>
                <li>Longevity noodles with an egg on top is eaten on people's birthdays. The noodles are meant to be
                  eaten without being bitten/broken apart. This is because the noodles are meant to represent long life,
                  and if you break them, it is seen as bad luck and an omen that your life may be short.</li>

            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                I was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At the time my
                parents did not have much money as they had only recently moved to Canada a few years before I was born
                and because they did not want any money from my relatives. About a year after I was born, I was brought
                to China by my grandma. I stayed in China and was raised by my Grandma for 2 years, while my parents
                focused on their work in Canada. My parents would visit me as often as they could. Eventually, I came
                back to Canada with my grandparents. Because I had spent quite a lot of time in China, my first
                language was Mandarin and I often found it difficult to talk to people in my pre-school. After a few
                years in Canada, my first language became English. Though I got better at English, I started to forget
                words and phrases in Chinese. Eventually, my parents enrolled me in Chinese classes. I have stopped
                taking these Chinese classes now since my Mandarin had gotten better (I still sometimes forget basic
                words, especially when writing).

              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">Aside from Chinese class, I took many different out of
                school classes. I had started dance classes when I was 3 and art classes (which I stopped taking) at
                age 5. Some of the sports that I did growing up include soccer, badminton, swimming, skiing, and
                volleyball.</p>

                  lessons, I enjoy finding music I like online and playing it on my instruments.</li>

                  celebrities that I like. I also like to create drawings and paintings of anime characters that I like.
                  I sometimes use these paintings as decorations for my room.</li>
                <li>I  enjoy reading, especially when I am stressed. When I am reading, I become so immersed in the

                  most, per se. But I do enjoy fantasy. One of my current favorite series is "The Folk of the Air"
                  trilogy by Holly Black.</li>
                <li>Though I do not consider myself a "gamer", I do enjoy playing video games, mainly on my PC. I have
                  recently taken a break from gaming, trying to restrict the amount of time is spend playing video
                  games and trying not to have it get in the way of my school work.</li>
                <li>I am a fan of kpop. I first started listening to kpop a little less than two years ago. I enjoy not
                  only the music but also the choreography for their performances and the visuals for their music
                  videos. My current favorite kpop groups include BTS, Straykids, Seventeen, NCT, and Ateez.</li>
                <li>Along with kpop, I am also a fan of anime. I have watched anime growing up, starting with Naruto
                  and Sailor Moon. I don't have a favorite anime, but I am currently watching Jujutsu Kaisen and JJBA.</li>

                <li>When I am home I spend most of my free time either watching YouTube/Netflix or messaging my friends on
                  discord.</li>
                <li>When I hanging out with my friends (not that much now, since there is Corona),  we mainly like to go
                  shopping, watch a movie at someone's house (sleepover), or go to the Rec Room.</li>

              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>As mentioned before, I want to graduate high school and attend the University of Toronto. There, I
                  am hoping to study finance (or something else business-related) and either business law or
                  programming. I am not sure at the moment as I don't know what I will be good at.</li>
                <li>I have known the fact that I have wanted to study business since I was a kid.</li>
                <li>I hope to live in Toronto after I graduate from university, as my cousin lives there and can
                  possibly help me get a good job if I choose to study computer science. Additionally, my parents and
                  my aunt + uncle want to move to a small town near Toronto when they grow old.)</li>
                <li>I want to get a small apartment near downtown Toronto and also possibly get a dog since I have
                  wanted one since I was a kid.</li>
