            <h3>50-Word Description of Myself</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
              My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and
              raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade
              10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or
              clarification when needed.

          <h3>50-Word Description of My Career Plans</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
              My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to
              study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as
              I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as
              I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying
              computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software
              developer.
