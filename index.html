            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">My full name is Sadie Kan. I am Chinese, but I was born and
                raised in Canada. I am currently attending Lillian Osborne High School in Edmonton, Alberta, as a grade
                10 student. I am an introvert and prefer working alone, though I enjoy asking my friends for help or
                clarification when needed.</p>

            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">My current plan is to attend the University of Toronto to
                study business and either law or computer science. I am currently unsure about which option to choose as
                I can infer that I may find computer science more interesting, but I may not be as good in the field as
                I would be in law. If I do go into law, I plan to become a corporate lawyer. But, if I end up studying
                computer science at the university, I am hoping to become somewhere along the lines of a software
                developer.</p>

            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;"><b>Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese
                celebrations. This day marks the start of the new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration
                constantly changes, usually in late January or early February. In Chinese, it is called <i>"Chunjie"</i>
                which means "Spring Festival."</b></p>
              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth
                  and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year
                  and good luck.</li>
                <li>Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new
                  clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.</li>
                <li>This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)</li>
                <li>Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you
                  should not sweep or throw out the garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to
                  ensure that you do not wash away the good luck.</li>
                <li>On Chinese New Year, red packets (<i>"Hongboa"</i>) containing money are passed outs. This is
                  usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but it's also
                  exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.</li>
                <li><i>During this celebration, my family along with our family friends usually hold a series of large
                  parties. Each party takes place in a different person's house. We don't always have firecrackers, but
                  we still put up the decorations, eat special food, and hand out red packets at every party. We
                  sometimes go to China to celebrate if we have the time. Even if we can't visit our family, we still
                  send virtual red packets which we "snatch" and we also wish each other "xin nian kuai le" or “gong xi
                  fa cai”</i></li>
              </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;"><b>Every year, Chinese New Year's celebrates a zodiac animal.
                There are 12 zodiac animals, one for each year. The next Chinese New Year's festival in 2021 will be
                celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs also represent traits given to the people born in their
                year.</b></p>
              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>It is believed that your <i>"benming year"</i> (year of your zodiac animal) is the unluckiest year
                  for you, but it is also your rebirth year.</li>
              </ul>

            <article>
              <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;"><b>The Lantern Festival, celebrated on the 15th day of the
                first lunar month, concludes the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year). This festival takes place on the
                night of the first full moon in the lunar calendar and is dedicated to honoring the deceased.</b></p>
              <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
                <li>The main part of this festival is the lighting and release of lanterns. The lanterns are adorned
                  with artwork of traditional Chinese images and symbols. The Chinese word or lantern is similar to
                  another word meaning "new-born baby boy". These lanterns represent "illuminating the future and
                  giving birth." They are also a way for people to pray for their family and a prosperous future.
                  Women also walk under hanging lanterns in hopes of becoming pregnant and having a baby.</li>
                <li>Riddles are also written on the lanterns. People crowd around hoping to find an answer. If you do
                  have an answer, you go to the lantern owner, and if you are correct, you get a small prize.</li>
                <li>Lion dances are performed at this festival to ward off evil and pray for fortune and safety</li>
                <li>It is a tradition to eat <i>"tangyuan"</i> on this day. They represent wholeness and unity. By eating them,
                  you are expressing your best wishes towards your family and their future.</li>
