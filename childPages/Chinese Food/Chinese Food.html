          <ul>
            <li>My favorite foods are Chinese noodles, more specifically, _xiao mian_. Similar to how there is a variety of
              different types of pasta dishes, there is an abundant assortment of different Chinese noodle dishes.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Chongqing Xiao Mian: Spicy noodle dish served with thin noodles and usually a type of meat. The
                flavor is _"mala"_, which is spicy and numb.</li>
              <li>Zhajiangmian: This dish consists of a "fried sauce" containing fermented yellow soybean paste and
                a bit of sweat fermented wheat paste. In Mandarin, _zhajiang_ means "fried sauce". They also have
                something similar called jjajangmyeon in Korea.</li>
              <li>Sichuan Noodles: A spicy cold noodle dish that is also famous for its spicy and numbing flavors.</li>

          <b><h3>Steamed Stuffed Buns (<i>Baozi</i>/包子)</h3></b>
          <ul>
            <li>Steamed stuffed buns are similar to dumplings, except they are larger and have a thicker/more airy
              outer layer. The stuffing can vary but was originally minced beef and mutton. Though the origins are
              unclear, it is thought to be created as sacrifices for dead soldiers in battles by Zhuge Liang
              (politician and military strategist).</li>
