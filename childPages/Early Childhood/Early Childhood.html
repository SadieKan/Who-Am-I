          <h1>Early Childhood</h1>
          <section>
            <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
              I was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At the time my
              parents did not have much money as they had only recently moved to Canada a few years before I was born
              and because they did not want any money from my relatives. About a year after I was born, I was brought
              to China by my grandma. I stayed in China and was raised by my Grandma for 2 years, while my parents
              focused on their work in Canada. My parents would visit me as often as they could. Eventually, I came
              back to Canada with my grandparents. Because I had spent quite a lot of time in China, my first
              language was Mandarin and I often found it difficult to talk to people in my pre-school. After a few
              years in Canada, my first language became English. Though I got better at English, I started to forget
              words and phrases in Chinese. Eventually, my parents enrolled me in Chinese classes. I have stopped
              taking these Chinese classes now since my Mandarin had gotten better (I still sometimes forget basic
              words, especially when writing).
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">Aside from Chinese class, I took many different out of
              school classes. I had started dance classes when I was 3 and art classes (which I stopped taking) at
              age 5. Some of the sports that I did growing up include soccer, badminton, swimming, skiing, and
              volleyball.</p>
