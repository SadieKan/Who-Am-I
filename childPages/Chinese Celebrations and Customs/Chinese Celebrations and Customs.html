            <p><b>Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese celebrations. This day marks the start of the
              new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration constantly changes, usually in late January or early
              February. In Chinese, it is called <i>"Chunjie"</i>which means "Spring Festival."</b></p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <ul>
              <li>Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth
                and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year
                and good luck.</li>
                <li>Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new
                clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.</li>
                <li>This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)</li>
                <li>Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you
                should not sweep or throw out the garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to
                ensure that you do not wash away the good luck.</li>
                <li>On Chinese New Year, red packets (<i>"Hongboa"</i>) containing money are passed outs. This is
                usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but it's also
                exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.</li>
                <li><i>During this celebration, my family along with our family friends usually hold a series of large
                parties. Each party takes place in a different person's house. We don't always have firecrackers, but
                we still put up the decorations, eat special food, and hand out red packets at every party. We
                sometimes go to China to celebrate if we have the time. Even if we can't visit our family, we still
                send virtual red packets which we "snatch" and we also wish each other "xin nian kuai le" or “gong xi
                fa cai”</i></li>

            <b>Every year, Chinese New Year's celebrates a zodiac animal. There are 12 zodiac animals, one for each
            year. The next Chinese New Year's festival in 2021 will be celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs
            also represent traits given to the people born in their year.</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is believed that your <i>"benming year"</i> (year of your zodiac animal) is the unluckiest year
              for you, but it is also your rebirth year.</li>

            <b>The Lantern Festival, celebrated on the 15th day of the
              first lunar month, concludes the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year). This festival takes place on the
              night of the first full moon in the lunar calendar and is dedicated to honoring the deceased.</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The main part of this festival is the lighting and release of lanterns. The lanterns are adorned
              with artwork of traditional Chinese images and symbols. The Chinese word or lantern is similar to
              another word meaning "new-born baby boy". These lanterns represent "illuminating the future and
              giving birth." They are also a way for people to pray for their family and a prosperous future.
              Women also walk under hanging lanterns in hopes of becoming pregnant and having a baby.</li>
            <li>Riddles are also written on the lanterns. People crowd around hoping to find an answer. If you do
              have an answer, you go to the lantern owner, and if you are correct, you get a small prize.</li>
            <li>Lion dances are performed at this festival to ward off evil and pray for fortune and safety</li>
            <li>It is a tradition to eat <i>"tangyuan"</i> on this day. They represent wholeness and unity. By eating them,
              you are expressing your best wishes towards your family and their future.</li>

            <b>In most places around the world, your age when you are
              born is 0. Meanwhile, in China, a newborn baby is considered to be one year old at birth. Birthday
              celebrations are mainly for children and the elderly. Similar to many other Chinese celebrations, there
              are special foods eaten on birthdays along with traditions.</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A child's first birthday in China is important and is called <i>"Zhuazhou"</i>. There is usually a
              ceremony in which the child chooses from an assortment of items that will determine their future
              inclinations/capabilities. <i>I had chosen an abacus on my first birthday, which represents that I
              might enjoy working with money and may have a future as a financier/business person.</i>
            <li>Longevity noodles with an egg on top is eaten on people's birthdays. The noodles are meant to be
              eaten without being bitten/broken apart. This is because the noodles are meant to represent long life,
              and if you break them, it is seen as bad luck and an omen that your life may be short.</li>
            <li>In China, the people also have two birthdays, one following the lunar calendar, the other is the
              Gregorian calendar.</li>

              usually in September or early October. It is considered to be the second most important Chinese
              festival (after Chinese New Year) and is a day to celebrate together with your family. On this day,
              family members come together to eat mooncakes, worship the moon, eat dinner together. and display
              lanterns.</b>

            <li><i>Similar to other celebrations, either my family or one of the families we are friends with will
              host a party. Since moon cake is the staple of this festival, we are sure to eat lots of it.
              Sometimes, some of the moms will even make their own mooncakes</i></li>
