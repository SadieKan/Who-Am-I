              <p><b>Chinese New Year is one of the most well-known Chinese celebrations. This day marks the start of the
                new year on the Lunar. The date of the celebration constantly changes, usually in late January or early
                February. In Chinese, it is called <i>"Chunjie"</i>which means "Spring Festival."</b></p>

              <ul>
                <li>Firecrackers set off at midnight to scare off a monster called "Nian" that originates from a myth
                  and to keep away bad luck. Firecrackers are also used again in the morning to welcome the new year
                  and good luck.</li>
                  <li>Red clothing and decorations are worn/put up to also scare off the monster, Nian. Additionally, new
                  clothing is bought as it also is thought to bring good luck.</li>
                  <li>This celebration lasts for 15 days (16 if you count New Year's Eve)</li>
                  <li>Some people believe that one should not shower on New Year's Day. It is also believed that you
                  should not sweep or throw out the garbage before the fifth day of the celebrations. This is all to
                  ensure that you do not wash away the good luck.</li>
                  <li>On Chinese New Year, red packets (<i>"Hongboa"</i>) containing money are passed outs. This is
                  usually given from elders to the children as it is supposed to help transfer fortune, but it's also
                  exchanged between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.</li>
                  <li><i>During this celebration, my family along with our family friends usually hold a series of large
                  parties. Each party takes place in a different person's house. We don't always have firecrackers, but
                  we still put up the decorations, eat special food, and hand out red packets at every party. We
                  sometimes go to China to celebrate if we have the time. Even if we can't visit our family, we still
                  send virtual red packets which we "snatch" and we also wish each other "xin nian kuai le" or “gong xi
                  fa cai”</i></li>

            <b>Every year, Chinese New Year's celebrates a zodiac animal. There are 12 zodiac animals, one for each
              year. The next Chinese New Year's festival in 2021 will be celebrating the year of the rat. These zodiacs
              also represent traits given to the people born in their year.</b>
            </p>
            <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
              <li>It is believed that your <i>"benming year"</i> (year of your zodiac animal) is the unluckiest year
                for you, but it is also your rebirth year.</li>
