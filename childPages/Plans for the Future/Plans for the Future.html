          <li>As mentioned before, I want to graduate high school and attend the University of Toronto. There, I
            am hoping to study finance (or something else business-related) and either business law or
            programming. I am not sure at the moment as I don't know what I will be good at.</li>
          <li>I have known the fact that I have wanted to study business since I was a kid.</li>
          <li>I hope to live in Toronto after I graduate from university, as my cousin lives there and can
            possibly help me get a good job if I choose to study computer science. Additionally, my parents and
            my aunt + uncle want to move to a small town near Toronto when they grow old.)</li>
          <li>I want to get a small apartment near downtown Toronto and also possibly get a dog since I have
            wanted one since I was a kid.</li>
