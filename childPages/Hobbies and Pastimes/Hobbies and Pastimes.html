        <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
          <li>I have played the viola since I was 6 and the piano since I was 7. I can also play the violin,
            though I am not as good at it as I am at the other instruments. Though I do not like going to music
            lessons, I enjoy finding music I like online and playing it on my instruments.</li>
          <li>I enjoy art, more specifically, creating digital art, simple sketches, and sometimes acrylic
            painting. I am fond of drawing people, whether it be photos of random people from Pinterest or
            celebrities that I like. I also like to create drawings and paintings of anime characters that I like.
            I sometimes use these paintings as decorations for my room.</li>
          <li>I  enjoy reading, especially when I am stressed. When I am reading, I become so immersed in the
            book and the story that I almost forget my worries. I don't have a particular genre that I like the
            most, per se. But I do enjoy fantasy. One of my current favorite series is "The Folk of the Air"
            trilogy by Holly Black.</li>
          <li>Though I do not consider myself a "gamer", I do enjoy playing video games, mainly on my PC. I have
            recently taken a break from gaming, trying to restrict the amount of time is spend playing video
            games and trying not to have it get in the way of my school work.</li>
          <li>I am a fan of kpop. I first started listening to kpop a little less than two years ago. I enjoy not
            only the music but also the choreography for their performances and the visuals for their music
            videos. My current favorite kpop groups include BTS, Straykids, Seventeen, NCT, and Ateez.</li>
          <li>Along with kpop, I am also a fan of anime. I have watched anime growing up, starting with Naruto
            and Sailor Moon. I don't have a favorite anime, but I am currently watching Jujutsu Kaisen and JJBA.</li>

        <ul style="font-family:'Nunito', sans-serif;">
          <li>When I am home I spend most of my free time either watching YouTube/Netflix or messaging my friends on
            discord.</li>
          <li>When I hanging out with my friends (not that much now, since there is Corona),  we mainly like to go
            shopping, watch a movie at someone's house (sleepover), or go to the Rec Room.</li>
