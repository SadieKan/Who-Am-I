          <h1>Hobbies and Pastimes</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>I have played the viola since I was 6 and the piano since I was 7. I can also play the violin,
              though I am not as good at it as I am at the other instruments. Though I do not like going to music
              lessons, I enjoy finding music I like online and playing it on my instruments.</li>
            <li>I enjoy art, more specifically, creating digital art, simple sketches, and sometimes acrylic painting.
              I am fond of drawing people, whether it be photos of random people from Pinterest or celebrities that I
              like. I also like to create drawings and paintings of anime characters that I like. I sometimes use
              these paintings as decorations for my room.</li>
            <li>I enjoy reading, especially when I am stressed. When I am reading, I become so immersed in the book
              and the story that I almost forget my worries. I don't have a particular genre that I like the most,
              per se. But I do enjoy fantasy. One of my current favorite series is "The Folk of the Air" trilogy by
              Holly Black.</li>
            <li>Though I do not consider myself a "gamer", I do enjoy playing video games, mainly on my PC. I have
              recently taken a break from gaming, trying to restrict the amount of time is spend playing video games
              and trying not to have it get in the way of my school work.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of kpop. I first started listening to kpop a little less than two years ago. I enjoy not
              only the music but also the choreography for their performances and the visuals for their music videos.
              My current favorite kpop groups include BTS, Straykids, Seventeen, NCT, and Ateez.</li>
            <li>Along with kpop, I am also a fan of anime. I have watched anime growing up, starting with Naruto
              and Sailor Moon. I don't have a favorite anime, but I am currently watching Jujutsu Kaisen and JJBA.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>When I am home I spend most of my free time either watching YouTube/Netflix or messaging my
              friends on discord.</li>
            <li>When I hanging out with my friends (not that much now, since there is Corona),  we mainly like
              to go shopping, watch a movie at someone's house (sleepover), or go to the Rec Room.</li>
        </ul>
